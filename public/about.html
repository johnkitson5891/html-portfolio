<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is John. I'm 43, and from Totnes in Devon, United Kingdom.</p>

<p>I started my career in web development and web design in 2023.
  Throughout that year I made several websites from scratch using Elementor in Wordpress.

<p>More recently in February 2024 I embarked on teaching myself how to code. I am keen to help people increase their presence online</p>
